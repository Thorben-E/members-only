# passport-local-demo

A minimal implementation of PassportJS with LocalStrategy, which renders the authentication failure messages in the View.

I had a heck of a time finding documentation of this behavior, let alone an implementation that didn't require custom callbacks for `passport.authenticate()`, and so I wanted to share a simple working example.
